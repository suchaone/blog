        <h1>Notes on Geertz Clifford's <em>Religion As a Cultural System</em></h1>
        <p class="abstract">Below is my point-form summary of Geertz Clifford's essay (<em><strong><a href="clifford_religion_as_cultural_system.pdf">download pdf</a></strong></em>). My comments are available as side notes (see dotted underlines). At the bottom there is an <a href="#analysis-of-contemporary-religions">analysis of some contemporary "religions"</a> using this framework.</p>
        <h2>a religion is...</h2>
        <ol class="abstract">
          <li>a <a href="#system-of-symbols">system of symbols</a> which acts to
          <li>establish <a href="#moods-and-motivations">powerful, pervasive, and long lasting moods and motivations</a> by
          <li>formulating <a href="#order-of-existence">conceptions of a general order of existence</a> and
          <li>clothing these conception with such an <a href="#aura-of-factuality">aura of factuality</a> that
          <li>the moods and motivations seem <a href="#uniquely-realistic">uniquely realistic</a>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="system-of-symbols">a system of symbols</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> a <strong>symbol</strong> is any object, act, event, quality, or relation which serves as a vehicle for a conception
          <ul>
            <li>the conception is the symbol's "meaning"
            <li>symbols are tangible formulations of notions, abstractions from experience fixed in perceptible forms, concrete embodiments of ideas, attitudes, judgements, longings, or beliefs.
            <li>a symbol is an abstraction of empirical reality
            <li>...but it's important to not mistake the map for the territory
            <li>objects and people may function as symbols, but they are not symbols as such
            <li>examples of symbols: the number 6, the cross, a specific painting, a churinga, the word "reality", the morpheme "-ing"
          </ul>
          <li>
            <strong>culture patterns</strong> are systems or complexes of symbols; extrinsic sources of information
            <ul>
              <li><strong>extrinsic</strong>: unlike genes, they lie outside the boundaries of the organism, in the world of common understandings 
              <li><strong>sources of information</strong>: like genes, they provide a blueprint which gives form to processes extenral to themselves
              <li>culture patterns provide programs for the institution of social and psychological processes which shape public behavior
              <li>culturally programmed processes are important for humans since human behavior is very loosely determined by intrinsic (genetic) sources of information 
              <li>to build a dam, a beaver only needs an appropriate site and material (mode of procedure is shaped by its physiology) but a human needs symbols to get the conception of building a dam
            </ul>
          <li><strong>models <em>for</em></strong> vs. <strong>models <em>of</em></strong>
            <ul>
              <li>in nature, there are many models <em>for</em> function: genes, imprint learning, bee dances
              <li>model <em>of</em> is a representation of a structure in another medium; it's far rarer in nature
              <li>culture patterns are both models <em>for</em> and models <em>of</em> 
              <li>symbolic formulation allows us to intertranspose models <em>for</em> and models <em>of</em>
              <li>perceive structural congruence between the program and the programmed 
              <li>the program is a conception/representation/symbol of the programmed
             <li>religion is interesting not because it describes the social order, but because it shapes it
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="moods-and-motivations">powerful, pervasive, long-lasting moods &amp; motivations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>intertransposition in practice: the virtues instilled by a Lakota vision quest are the same virtues by which they attempt to live
          <li>religious ritual expresses the world's climate and shapes it
            <ul>
              <li>shapes it by inducing a dispositions which lend a chronic character to the flow of his activity and quality of his experience
              <li>disposition is not an activity, but the probability that an activity will be performed in certain circumstances
              <li>other terms for this: capacities, tendencies, propensities, habits, mental traits, psychological forces
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            two kinds of dispositions: motivations and moods
            <ul>
              <li>a <strong>motivation</strong> is conceived towards a particular end, and is meaningful with reference to it
              <li>a <strong>mood</strong> is meaningful with reference to the conditions from which it is conceived
              <li>we interpret motivations in terms of their consummations, but moods in terms of their sources
              <li>can experience multiple motivations at a time, but only one mood
              <li>a motivation is religious if it has a religious consummation (religious fasting vs. fasting for weight loss)
              <li>a mood is religious if its source is religious (religious awe vs. awe at nature)
              <li>sacred symbols induce moods like reverence and solemnity, but also exultation, melancholy, self-confidence, self-pity, arrogance, playfulness, listlessness, arousal, etc.
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="order-of-existence">conceptions of a general order of existence</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>religion is not merely a set of morals and rituals; it must <strong>affirm</strong> some claims about reality
          <li>Max Weber's <strong>problem of meaning</strong>: the suspicion that we're adrift in an absurd world, that our lives in the world have no order, empirical regularity, emotional form, or moral coherence
          <li>we're existentially dependent on symbols, and feel anxiety when we are unable to cope with aspects of experience
          <li>quote from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanne_Langer">Susanne Langer</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_in_a_New_Key">Philosophy in a New Key</a>:<br>"Man can adapt himself to anything his imagination can cope with; but he cannot deal with Chaos. Under mental stress even perfectly familiar things may become suddenly disorganized and give us the horrors. Our most important assets are always the symbols of our general <em>orientation</em> in nature, on the earth, in society, and in what we are doing."
          <li>
            <strong>chaos</strong> is the tumult of uninterpreted and uninterpretable events, which threatens us at three points (the three parts of the problem of meaning):
            <ul>
              <li>the <strong>limits of our analytic capabilities</strong> (the problem of bafflement): we are unable to leave the stranger parts of the world unclarified, staring at them with dumb astonishment or apathy; must reconcile them with ordinary experience; religion affirms explicability of experience
              <li>the <strong>limits of our endurance</strong> (the problem of suffering): not "how to avoid suffering", but "how to suffer"; religion affirms sufferableness
              <li>the <strong>limits of our moral insight</strong> (the problem of evil): the adequacy of our symbolic resources to provide a workable set of ethical criteria, normative guides to govern our action
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            the religious solution to the problem of meaning: using symbols to formulate an image of a world order which will account for (even celebrate) the ambiguities, puzzles, and paradoxes in human experience
            <ul>
              <li>systems of symbols provided by religion allow us to comprehend and endure the world
              <li>religion affirms unexplained events, suffering, and injustice, but denies that there are inexplicable events, that life is unendurable, and that justice is a mirage
              <li>this is done by relating man's sphere of existence to a wider sphere of symbols
              <li>"the relatively modest dogma that God is not mad" â€” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_de_Madariaga">Salvador de Madariaga</a></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="aura-of-factuality">aura of factuality</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>how does religion convince anyone to believe in its denials and affirmations?
          <li>the problem of meaning is what drives people to religion, but it is not the basis of belief
          <li>
            belief is achieved not through baconian induction from experience but by accepting experience-transforming authority 
            <ul>
              <li>in tribal religions, authority lies in persuasive power of traditional imagery
              <li>in mystical religions it's in the apodictic force of supersensible experience
              <li>in charismatic ones in the hypnotic attraction of an extraordinary personality.
            </ul>
          <li>the state of the world is seen as illustrative of doctrine, not evidence for it (<a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/mac-over/#SSSH3bi1">A. MacIntyre</a>)
          <li>a <strong>perspective</strong> is a mode of seeing that extends the sense of "see" in which it means "discern", "apprehend", "understand", "grasp"; a way of looking at life, construing the world
          <li>how does the <strong>religious perspective</strong> ("he who would know must first believe") differ from some of the other perspectives?

            in ritual, the lived world and imagined world, fused under the agency of a single set of symbolic forms, turns out to be the same world
            <ul>
              <li>this produces a transformation in one's sense of reality
              <li>a symbolic fusion of ethos and world view
              <li>the spiritual consciousness of a people is shaped by what Singer calls <strong>cultural performances</strong>: elaborate and public rituals that involve a broad range of moods and motivations on one hand, and metaphorical conceptions on the other
              <li>to believers, these rituals are not only models <em>of</em> what they believe, but also models <em>for</em> believing in it; faith is both portrayed and attained
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="uniquely-realistic">uniquely realistic moods and motivations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            no one lives in the world of religious symbols all the time, and most believers only live in it at moments
            <ul>
              <li>religious belief in the midst of ritual, where it engulfs the total person, transporting them into another mode of existence
              <li>religious belief as the pale, remembered reflection of that experience in everyday life is not the same thing
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            this leads to two types of confusion:
            <ul>
              <li>LÃ©vy-Bruhl view of primitive tribesmen as living entirely in a world of mystical encounters
              <li>Malinowski's view of them living in a world composed entirely of practical actions
              <li>both failed to see people moving easily and frequently between radically contrasting and discontinuous worldviews across which Kierkegaardian leaps must be made
            </ul>
          <li>paraphrased from Schutz' <em>The Problem of Social Reality</em>:<br> There are as many shock experiences as there are provinces of meaning. Some instances are: falling asleep, the fall of a theater curtain, limiting one's field of view to examine a painting, quandary relaxing into laughter, a child turning toward his toys as a transition into play-world, a scientist putting aside passionate participation in the world and replacing it with disinterested analytical attitude. Kierkegaard's "instant" (the point at which time and eternity intersect) is the shock of leaping into the religious sphere. 
          <li>
            what does a Bororo tribesman mean when he says "I am a parakeet"?
            <ul>
              <li>not that he is literally a parakeet (he doesn't try to mate with parakeets) and not that it's true mythically but false scientifically (this leads to Malinowski's pragmatism)
              <li>rather, the sentence has <em>a different sense</em> depending on context ("finite province of meaning")
              <li>in the religious, the Bororo is "really" a "parakeet" and in ritual context might "mate" with other "parakeets" (metaphysical ones like himself, not commonplace ones)
              <li>in the common-sense perspective he is a parakeet in the sense that he belongs to a clan whose members regard the parakeet as their totem, from which flow certain moral and practical consequences
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            religious ritual changes people
            <ul>
              <li>in ritual, a believer "leaps" into the framework of meaning defined by religious conceptions
              <li>after the ritual ends, the believer returns to the common-sense world and is changed
              <li>in the believer's view, the common-sense world has also changed, since it is now seen as the partial form of a wider reality which corrects and completes it
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            the change is idiosyncratic to the specific religion
            <ul>
              <li>the induced moods and motivations differ from religion to religion and from ritual to ritual
            </ul>
          </li>
